Using Python on Windows
=========================

Python itself is very platform independent. The code you write will be exactlty the same regardless of platform you are running, unless you want to acess specific system services. However, the tools required to install and work with python and associated packages are somewhat different. Also, as Python comes from, and is mostly used by, the FOSS world, many instructions you will find online are *nix oriented, and many packages are set up and tested primarily on Linux and/or OS-X.

Nevertheless, Python works just fine on Windows once you get yourself properly set up.

The following are few notes that should help you get running on Windows.

Installing Python
====================

There are a number of Python distributions out there, some specifically designed to provide a full featured set of packages, often oreinted to scientific programming. These include: Enthought Canopy, Continuum's Anaconda, and Python(xy). However the prome advantage of these sywtems is getting hard-to-build-and-install scientific packages -- they maynot be as useful for the UW certificate program. So we will recommend a more compact route:

python.org binaries

We recommend the binary installer available from python.org:
