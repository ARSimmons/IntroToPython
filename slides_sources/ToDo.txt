Things to do for the UWPCE INtro to Python class:

For Session 2:

Note: I decided to not confuse things with unicode off teh bat --
so I'm stripping the 'u' from string literals wherever I find them.

Update presentaion for UWPCE instead of CodeFellows
 - mention of CodeFellows
 - urls for git

 Add outline of class to beginning of slides

 Add section breaks to slides for LAB time and lightning talks:
    some lecture
    some lab time
    two lightning talks

General slide proofread and clean up for layout, etc.

I think we shouod remove the parameter unpacking: *args and **kwargs --
too mcuh when you dn't really know what a tuple or dict is...

Add more to the function lab -- should be 20min or so of work.
  - they have learned about returning multiple values.

Put in solution to this weeks homework in Solutions
  --Chris has soem kicking around to find...


Future Sessions:

Add discusion of parameter unpacking: *args and **kwargs
