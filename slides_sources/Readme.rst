Sources for Slides / Materials
===============================

This directory holds the source materials (ResructuredTExt, mostly) used
to build the slides and HTML pages for the class.

The ``old_versions`` dir has older version of the materials, done in LaTeX.
The contents are a bit different and have been updated. There are just
there for reference.
